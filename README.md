1.	[Drawing](drawing/index.html)
   
This project is a visual representation of human relationships and digital ones and the difference between them. This specific code is about the intimate physical action of hugs and kisses in the form of x’s and o’s communicated through text messages. How does this simply letter convey so much and used everyday in text? Most of the code is created using the draw function. I created four circles, one x from two lines and one ellipse. This created two faces. The creation of the variable to move the circles was made for functionality. The reason why the circles move continuously is to portray how everyone uses this message and how it is an international symbol known worldwide. The x’s and o’s stay stationary, and they are just a letter recycle repeatedly as an action through people. I had struggle making the circles move without lagging and not looping. However, I did manage to get them moving. Inspired by Aesthetic programming.

3.	Movement
   
This code was inspired by artist Barbara Kurga ‘Thinking of you. I mean me. I mean you.’ Her work is about the nature of identities and the relationship between self and others. She uses visual language in environment that therefore require a bodily presence. It collapses the boundary between human and digital relationships. Typography is everywhere and can create a virtual audience. I used an array to store the text and used an offset to create the movement, bringing the text up the canvas. I wanted to create a loop of text, so it doesn’t suddenly stop but I struggled to do this. Instead, I increased the space after the text to it appears like a seamless transition. 

5.	multiples
   
This code presents the visual form of gird cells in the brain. This is a cell the is used to create a grid like representation of space and activates at specific locations, helping navigate environments. Gird cells are also used in technology, specifically as fuel cells and artificial intelligence. This therefore shows the link between humans and technology, creating a relationship. the base of the code is from the notion. I changed the colour of the rectangles to be white and the background to be black. I also changed the spacing of the rectangles. For the circles I created a random movement with 400 circles. I had individually place 
each of the circles one by one but decided to randomly place them.

7.	Media
   
The final code used my own image of the lake District combined with the original sound of rain and a computer fan fading into each other. I loaded the image and sounds and then used the function mouse click to start the computer sound that fades into the rain. This presents the similar sounds we hear though out nature and technology like they slowly merge into each other, like we slowly depend on technology. This links to the previous Multiples code. I had struggle with the idea of the code, and I had struggled to get the sound working.
